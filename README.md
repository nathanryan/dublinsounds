4th year android application for multimedia and mobile app module

This assignment required me to develop a small, but complete, Android app with the following requirements:

- (At least) Three Activities
- Camera / Video functionality
- Asynchronous network calls
- Local Database
- Maps / GPS / Location

The application is designed to inform users of the number of different events and concert venues in Dublin and has 4 main components; Gigs, Venues, Radio and Camera. 
The application uses the Bandsintown API to pull data on music acts through a search. 
The Venues activity allows users to see where the different Concert Venues in Dublin are located using Google Maps and can see information on these venues retrieved from the Local SQLite Database. 
The Radio activity allows users to listen to listen to Dublin Airport and play ambient music at the same time providing a relaxing experience (inspired by http://listentothe.cloud/). 
The Camera function allows the user to take a picture (preferably at a concert or music event) and apply a fun filter.
